Exadata is a database machine designed by Oracle that provides users with optimized functionality pertaining to enterprise class databases and their 
associated workloads. Exadata is a composite database server machine that uses Oracle database software and the hardware server equipment developed by 
Sun Microsystems.

Oracle calls Exadata the fastest database server ever built, primarily due to its highly powerful and intelligent database, where query completion 
time is 10 times faster, even in a huge data warehouse.

Exadata is a database appliance that has the capability to provide support to a combination of database systems such as OLTP and OLAP, the transactional
and analytical database systems. Exadata was initially designed in a collaborative effort between Oracle and HP, in which Oracle powered the Linux-based OS 
and database software, while HP designed the system's server hardware. However, after Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, Exadata Version 2 came 
to use Sun Microsystems Storage Systems technology.
