Star Schema in data warehouse, in which the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables. It is known as star schema 
as its structure resembles a star. The Star Schema data model is the simplest type of Data Warehouse schema. It is also known as Star Join Schema and is optimized 
for querying large data sets.

Snowflake Schema in data warehouse is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database such that the ER diagram resembles a snowflake shape. 
A Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions. The dimension tables are normalized which splits data into additional tables.

Following is a key difference between Snowflake schema vs Star schema:

Star Schema	                                                                    Snowflake Schema
Hierarchies for the dimensions are stored in the dimensional table.	       Hierarchies are divided into separate tables.

It contains a fact table surrounded by dimension tables.                 	One fact table surrounded by dimension table which are in turn surrounded by dimension table
In a star schema, only single join creates the relationship 
between the fact table and any dimension tables.	                        A snowflake schema requires many joins to fetch the data.

Simple DB Design.                                                        	Very Complex DB Design.

Denormalized Data structure and query also run faster.	                  Normalized Data Structure.

High level of Data redundancy	                                            Very low-level data redundancy

Single Dimension table contains aggregated data.	                         Data Split into different Dimension Tables.

Cube processing is faster.	                                                Cube processing might be slow because of the complex join.

Offers higher performing queries using Star Join Query Optimization.
Tables may be connected with multiple dimensions.                          	The Snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact table which unlikely connected
                                                                            with multiple dimensions.
